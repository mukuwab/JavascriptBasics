 Introduction:

Unit testing is a critical skill in software development, enabling you to verify that individual units of code work as expected. This lab introduces Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework, and walks you through writing a unit test for a simple function.

Goal:

 The goal of this lab is to familiarize learners with writing and running unit tests using Jest.  

Objectives: 

Install Jest as a development dependency using npm.

Configure the package.json file for Jest testing.

Write and export JavaScript functions for testing.

Write unit tests using Jest's test() and expect() functions.

Learner Instructions: 

Lab Tasks: 

Task 1: Add Jest as a Development Dependency  

Objective: Learn how to install Jest using npm and configure it as a development dependency in a JavaScript project. 

Steps:
Step 1: Navigate to Terminal > New Terminal and execute the npm install jest --save-dev command to install Jest.

Step 2: Verify the installation:

Open the package.json file present under the Jest-Testing folder. 

Confirm the presence of the following entry: 

123
"devDependencies": {
    "jest": "^29.7.0"
}

Task 2: Update the test Script 

Objective: Understand how to modify the scripts section of package.json to include a Jest test runner. 

Steps:
Step 1: In the package.json file, locate the "scripts" section and update the "test" entry as follows: 

123
"scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
}

Task 3: Code the timesTwo Function

Objective: Implement a JavaScript function to perform a basic calculation and export it for use in a separate module. 

Steps:
Step 1: Open the timesTwo.js file present under the Jest-Testing folder. 

Step 2: Implement the timesTwo function:  

It should take a number as input and return the number multiplied by 2.

Step 3: Export the function as a module:

1
module.exports = timesTwo;
Step 4: After successfully modifying the timesTwo.js file, navigate to File > Save to save changes in the file.  


Task 4: Write the First Test

Objective: Write a unit test using Jest's test() and expect() functions to verify the correctness of the timesTwo function. 

Steps:
Step 1: Open the timesTwo.test.js file present under the Jest-Testing folder. 

Step 2: Write a test for the timesTwo function:

Use the test() function with the description: "returns the number times 2".

Ensure the test checks that calling timesTwo(10) returns 20. 

123
test('returns the number times 2', () => {
    expect(timesTwo(10)).toBe(20);
});
Step 3: After successfully modifying the timesTwo.test.js file, navigate to File > Save to save changes in the file.   


Task 5: Run the First Test

Objective: Execute Jest tests via npm, interpret the results, and ensure the function meets its expected behavior.

Steps:
Step 1: In the terminal, execute the npm test command to run the test script.

Step 2: Verify that the test passes, and observe the output in the terminal.

Key Takeaways:

Unit tests help validate the behavior of small, isolated parts of a codebase. 

Jest provides an easy-to-use API for writing and running tests.

 Use npm install --save-dev to add packages needed during development, like Jest.
