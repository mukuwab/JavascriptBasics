/* The spread operator is used to expand elements of an array, object, or iterable into individual items. Itâ€™s represented by three dots (...). For arrays, it allows us to easily extract or spread values, making operations like splitting arrays or merging arrays simpler. */

first gets the value 1.

second gets the value 2.

remaining is assigned the rest of the elements as a subarray [3, 4, 5].
