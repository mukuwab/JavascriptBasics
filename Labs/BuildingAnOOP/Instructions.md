Introduction:

In this lab, you will explore object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in JavaScript. You'll create classes, extend them with inheritance, and instantiate objects with unique properties and methods. By the end of this lab, you'll understand how to use OOP to structure and organize your code effectively. 

Goal:

The goal of this lab is to help learners grasp the principles of object-oriented programming, including class creation, inheritance, and object instantiation.

Objectives: 

Create classes and define constructors with default parameter values. 

Use inheritance to extend functionality from a parent class.

Add and override methods in subclasses.

Instantiate objects and assign unique properties to each instance.

Learner Instructions: 

Lab Tasks: 

Task 1: Code a Person Class

Objective: Create a Person class to represent basic human attributes and actions.

Steps:
Step 1: Open the ooprogramming.js file present under the LEARN folder. This is where you will write your object-oriented program. 

Step 2: Define a Person class with the following parameters in the constructor:

name (default: "Tom")

age (default: 20)  

energy (default: 100)

Step 3: Add the following methods to the class:

sleep(): Increases the energy property by 10.

doSomethingFun(): Decreases the energy property by 10.

Task 2: Code a Worker Class

Objective: Extend the Person class to create a Worker class with additional attributes and functionality.

Steps:
Step 1: Define a Worker class that inherits from the Person class.

Step 2: Add two additional parameters to the Worker constructor:

xp (default: 0)

hourlyWage (default: 10)

Step 3: Add the following method to the Worker class:

goToWork(): Increases the xp property by 10. 

Task 3: Code an Intern Object

Objective: Instantiate the Worker class to create an intern object with specific attributes.

Steps:
Step 1: Inside the intern() function, create a new Worker object with the following properties: 

name: "Bob"

age: 21

energy: 110

xp: 0

hourlyWage: 10

Step 2: Call the goToWork() method on the intern object.

Step 3: Return the intern object.  

Task 4: Code a Manager Object

Objective: Instantiate the Worker class to create a manager object with specific attributes.

Steps:
Step 1: Inside the manager() function, create a new Worker object with the following properties: 

name: "Alice"  

age: 30

energy: 120

xp: 100

hourlyWage: 30

Step 2: Call the doSomethingFun() method on the manager object.

Step 3: Return the manager object. 

Step 4: After successfully modifying the ooprogramming.js file, navigate to File > Save to save changes in the file.

To execute your modified JavaScript code and verify the function is working:

Click the Run Code button in the top-right corner (shaped like a triangular "Play" button).

Key Takeaways:

Use the class keyword to define a blueprint for objects. Constructors initialize properties with default or custom values. 

Use the extends keyword to create a subclass, inheriting all properties and methods from a parent class. Subclasses can have their own unique properties and methods.

Instantiate classes to create specific objects with unique attributes.  Use constructor arguments to customize the properties of each instance.

Methods define specific behaviours that operate on the object's properties, encapsulating functionality within the class.  

OOP makes code modular, reusable, and easier to understand.

Final Step: Submit Your Code:

Go to File > Save to ensure your work is saved.

Submit your assignment: Click the "Submit Assignment" button in the Lab toolbar.  

Your code will be autograded and feedback will be available shortly on the Grades tab.
